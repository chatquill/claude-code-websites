# Recommended External Skills (dependencies)

The studio reuses proven public skills instead of re-writing them. They are
**optional**: every studio skill that uses one falls back to its own checklist
and tells you the dependency is missing. `/install-deps` installs them.

## Install

```text
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills
/plugin install example-skills@anthropic-agent-skills

/plugin marketplace add vercel-labs/agent-skills
# then install the skills listed below from that marketplace
```

Playwright MCP (browser automation for e2e, a11y and perf audits):

```bash
claude mcp add playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest
```

## Precedence

Project documents (`docs/design/brand-guide.md`, the design system, specs) and
your decisions override a dependency skill's defaults. A dependency's
guidance is input, not a verdict.

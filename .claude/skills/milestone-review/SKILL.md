# Milestone Review

Asks one honest question: did this milestone deliver its exit criterion? It
writes the review into `production/milestones/<slug>-review.md`. It never
moves dates or cuts scope by itself; it gives the user options.

## Inputs

- `production/milestones/<slug>.md` (exit criterion, planned epics/stories, dates)
- `bash .claude/scripts/story-list.sh` (status of every story)
- Sprint files in `production/sprints/`, latest audits, open bugs in `production/bugs/`
- Metrics from `production/analytics/` if the milestone has a metric target

If no slug is given, list milestones and ask which.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Facts

Compute: stories planned vs done vs carried over, points planned vs delivered,
bugs opened/closed by severity, audits run and open Critical/High findings,
dates planned vs actual. Show them as a table before any judgement.

### Phase 2: Exit criterion

Spawn `producer` for the `PR-MILESTONE` gate with the facts and the exit
criterion. Evidence must be concrete: a demo the user can run, a passing
journey, a metric value. Verdict: `MET`, `PARTIALLY MET`, `NOT MET`, or
`NOT ASSESSED` (naming the missing input).

### Phase 3: Learn

What slipped and why (estimates, scope added, blockers, unknowns), what went
well, and the estimate accuracy ratio to calibrate future planning.

### Phase 4: Options

For anything not met, offer 2–3 options with costs: extend the milestone,
move items to the next milestone, cut scope (name it), or accept as is. The
user decides; record the decision.

### Phase 5: Write

Ask "May I write this to `production/milestones/<slug>-review.md`?"
(template `milestone-review`). Suggest `/retrospective` for process changes.

## Output

`production/milestones/<slug>-review.md` (template: `.claude/docs/templates/milestone-review.md`).

## Next step

`/retrospective`, then `/sprint-plan` for the next milestone.

# Help: where am I, what next?

Read-only. It never writes files and never runs the skill it suggests.

## With an argument

- `all` → print the skill catalogue from `docs/WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md` grouped by stage.
- a topic (e.g. `payments`, `seo`, `testing`) → list the 2–5 skills and agents
  most relevant to it, one line each, using `docs/BLUEPRINT.md` §4 and the
  `description:` lines in `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`.

## Without an argument

1. Run `bash .claude/scripts/project-state.sh`.
2. If nothing is configured (no stage, no stack, no brief): say so and suggest `/start`. Stop.
3. Otherwise pick the **first unmet** row for the current stage:

| Stage | Check (in order) | Suggest |
|---|---|---|
| discovery | `brief: no` | `/brainstorm` |
| | `prd: no` | `/write-prd` |
| | `personas: 0` and rigor ≠ minimal | `/personas` |
| | all present | `/gate-check discovery` |
| design | `stack_frontend` and `stack_backend` empty | `/setup-stack` |
| | `brand_guide: no` (not `api` type) | `/brand-identity` |
| | `design_system: no` (not `api` type) | `/design-system` |
| | `ux_docs: 0` (not `api` type) | `/ux-flow` |
| | `feature_specs: 0` | `/feature-spec` |
| | `architecture: no` | `/create-architecture` |
| | all present | `/gate-check design` |
| build | `epics: 0` | `/create-epics` |
| | `stories: 0` | `/create-stories` |
| | `sprints: 0` | `/sprint-plan` |
| | `tests: 0` and `source_files` > 0 | `/test-setup` |
| | otherwise | `/dev-story` (next ready story) or `/sprint-status` |
| launch | no `production/audits/` reports | `/team-launch` (or the individual audits) |
| | `releases: 0` | `/launch-checklist` |
| grow | — | `/analytics-plan`, `/experiment`, `/retrospective` |

4. Reply in at most six lines: stage, what exists, the **one** next step and
   why, and one alternative. If `active_session: yes`, mention that
   `production/session-state/active.md` holds where the last session stopped.

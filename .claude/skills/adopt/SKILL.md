# Adopt an existing project

Maps what already exists so the rest of the studio has something to build on.
It writes only `project.yaml` values (through `config-set.sh`, after an
explicit yes) and the stage. It never changes application code, never
installs anything, and never generates docs; `/reverse-document` does that.

## Inputs

- `bash .claude/scripts/detect-stack.sh` (frontend, backend, database, orm, hosting, test tools, package manager)
- `bash .claude/scripts/project-state.sh`
- Manifests: `package.json` (deps + scripts), `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `composer.json`, `Gemfile`, lockfiles
- Framework config (`next.config.*`, `nuxt.config.*`, `astro.config.*`, `svelte.config.*`, `angular.json`), `compose.yaml`, `Dockerfile`, `.github/workflows/`, host config (`vercel.json`, `netlify.toml`, `wrangler.toml`, `fly.toml`, `render.yaml`)
- `.claude/docs/stack-matrix.md` for value names and specialists
- `git log --oneline -20` for activity
- Optional argument: code root (monorepo app path such as `apps/web`)

## Phases

### Phase 1: Detect

Run both helpers. Then confirm the important guesses by reading the manifest
and config files yourself: a helper guess is an observation, not a fact. For a
monorepo (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`, `nx.json`, `apps/*`), list the
apps and ask which one the studio should treat as the code root.

### Phase 2: Map what exists

Build a short inventory:

| Area | Look for |
|---|---|
| Routes / pages | `app/`, `pages/`, `src/routes/`, `routes/` (count, list top-level sections) |
| API | route handlers, `server/api`, controllers, OpenAPI files |
| Data | `prisma/schema.prisma`, `drizzle/`, `migrations/`, models |
| Auth / payments / CMS / AI / email | SDK imports and env var names in `.env.example` (never open `.env`) |
| Tests | runner config, test file count, e2e folder |
| CI / deploy | workflow files, host config |
| Docs | README, `docs/`, ADRs, any PRD-like text |

### Phase 3: Propose project.yaml

Show a table of proposed values: `project.name`, `project.type`, every
`stack.*` key detected, `paths.code_root`, and `specialists:` (from
`stack-matrix.md`). Mark each **detected** or **guessed**. Ask the user to
correct anything wrong, then: "May I save these to `project.yaml`?"

On yes, run `config-set.sh` per key. `specialists` is a list: write it with
`config-set.sh specialists=[a, b, c]` (inline list).

### Phase 4: Propose the stage

| Evidence | Proposed stage |
|---|---|
| Little code, no PRD | `discovery` |
| Working code, users not yet live | `build` |
| Deployed to a production domain with users | `grow` (or `launch` if a release is imminent) |

Ask the user to confirm, then run `set-stage.sh <stage>`. Ask about rigor and
automation only if `modes.rigor` / `modes.automation` are unset (same options
as `/start` Phases 4–5).

### Phase 5: Report gaps

List the studio artifacts missing for the chosen stage (see
`.claude/docs/gates.md`), most important first, and the template-remote
warning if `origin_url` still points at the studio template.

## Output

`project.yaml` values and `project.stage` only.

## Next step

`/reverse-document` to generate the PRD, specs, architecture and data model
from the code. Then `/help`.
